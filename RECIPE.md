Sautéing Onion Paste
Heat ghee in a frying pan on medium-low to medium heat.
Fry all the whole spices (listed in the above ingredients) until they release their aroma in the ghee. Be very attentive here, as spices are delicate and can burn quickly if you aren’t paying attention.
Add the ground onion paste and mix very well. On a low heat sauté stirring non-stop for 7 to 8 minutes or until the fat starts to leave the sides of the paste.
Add red chilli powder or cayenne pepper, garam masala powder and coriander powder. Mix well.

Adding Curd And Simmering Further
Reduce heat to a low or switch off the heat. Add the whisked yogurt, 1 to 1.5 cups of the strained stock and additional water, sugar and salt as required.
Mix very well and simmer gravy for 10 to 12 minutes until it thickens.
Add the cardamom powder and crushed saffron.
Stir and add the cubed paneer and cream.
Mix gently and switch off heat.
Add the kewra water and stir. You can even add rose water.
Garnish Shahi Paneer with some coriander leaves or mint leaves or a few saffron strands. Serve the Mughlai Shahi Paneer with cumin rice or roti, naan or paratha.
